## Minimalist Web Portfolio with Next.js

This repository provides a starter template for a minimalist web portfolio built with Next.js.

**Features:**

* **Next.js:** Leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
* **Minimalist Design:** Clean and uncluttered layout prioritizes content.
* **Customizable:** Easily adapt the content, styles, and layout to your preferences.

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* Basic understanding of Next.js concepts is recommended.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minimalist-nextjs-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd minimalist-nextjs-portfolio
   npm install
   ``` (or `yarn install`)

3. **Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ``` (or `yarn dev`)

   This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000 by default.

**Content Structure:**

The portfolio uses Next.js pages for each section. The default project structure includes:

* `pages/`: Contains Next.js pages for different sections.
    * `index.js`: The hero section.
    * `about.js`: The about me section.
    * `portfolio.js`: The portfolio section.
    * `contact.js`: The contact section.
* `styles/`: Contains stylesheets for the portfolio.
    * `globals.css`: Defines global styles for the entire website.
    * `[componentName].module.css`: Component-specific styles.
* `public/`: Stores static assets like images and fonts.

**Customization:**

* Edit the content in the respective page files (e.g., `about.js`, `portfolio.js`).
* Update styles in the `styles/` directory.
* Add your own images and assets to the `public/` directory.

**Deployment:**

You can deploy this portfolio to various platforms that support Next.js deployments, such as Vercel, Netlify, or custom server setups. Refer to their respective documentation for specific instructions.
